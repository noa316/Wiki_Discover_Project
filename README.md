# Wiki_Discover_Project
Random Wikipedia Article Project

Summary:
Using Flask and the MediaWiki API, I created a webpage that shows users the title of a completely random article from Wikipedia. The website asks users whether they are interested in reading the full article. If they are, then they either press on a button that takes them to the article, or they press another button that opens the article up on a new tab. If they are not interested, they can press another button that will generate a new random title. The new tab button allows them to stack a few interesting articles at a time on their web browser.
